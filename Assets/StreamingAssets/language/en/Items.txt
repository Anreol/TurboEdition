Sorry we\'ve been gone for a while, you holding in there?\r\n\r\nWell, I\'ll tell you what, we\'ve definitely got it together here. We\'ve been exploring planets all across our solar system, and we've found all sorts of gemstones, forgotten tools, artifacts, and even made new friends, something an old man like me would never get the chance to do in the current times. So, back to this story. We were exploring through a forest, well, more like a jungle, in the Northern Hemisphere of Celonias, and while crossing a big glade, we came across these weird wings laying on the grass in the middle of nowhere. They were a bit bloody and somehow twitching.\n\r\n\rRight after picking them up, we kept moving along through the trees and accidently hit the edge of a cliff. The guide nearly fell off since he was going first, but your mother and I managed to save the situation! It was like an angel came and helped us, and somehow the wings were some kind of premonition. After that, we took a break and turned back, as there wasn\'t any way to go beyond there. We\'re sending this to you as a gift and to see if you know anything more about it. You\'ve always been interested in things like this. Our guide said that he hasn\'t seen anything like that in that planet, so maybe we found a new species... I\'ll leave it to the experts. (That\'s you! Don\'t let me down!).\r\n\r\nLove you, and see you soon!",
