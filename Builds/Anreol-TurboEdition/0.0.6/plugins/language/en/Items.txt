In the package you'll find the gadget, you don't get to bring more equipment in this job. The gadget will eventually melt and it won't work so good by where the location of the lockbox is, and a lot of effort for smuggling it, so don't let it go to waste. Put it next to your throat and it will change your voice to match your target's. People will probably care if you put it on, so you can swallow it instead and it will still do its function.\r\n\r\nAfter the last job, they will be expecting you, and they want you dead, so when you are done disposing the target, take it off, mind you that if you are wearing the later way, it might be extremely painful. Then, stick it to someone else. It will modify their voice, scaring off the remaining people around, attracting attention from the security forces, and getting caught.
