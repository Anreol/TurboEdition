# Turbo Edition TEST-RELEASE
# **NOTE:** THIS CURRENT RELEASE IS MEANT FOR **PLAYTESTING** AND IS **NOT** A RELEASE BUILD. In-dev content is enabled and there might be bugs everywhere. 
### **Note:** This is a very heavy **WIP** mod, **issues and bugs** can arise.
The mod has been tested and while *most features* are multiplayer compatible, some things may not work.

Turbo Edition is a content pack mod, that for now, it adds a couple of weird items and equipments.
Based off Risk Of Rain's Turbo Edition, it has a few returning items and new ones, but the goal of this mod is not to be a direct port, so keep in mind that some items will never come back, but it adds new ones, (and new features! *Soon!* )
Keep in mind that this is a single man made mod, so if you expected something big, I'm sorry to break it to you, but I cannot do everything at once!

Installation looks like
- plugins
	- TurboEdition
		- TurboEdition.dll
		- language, assetbundles and soundbank folders
## Why?
I'm pretty bad at coming up with names for what I make, and I followed Turbo Edition's development and just liked what it was.
I also find *"Turbo"* a funny word that goes along pretty well with a lot of other words. You can probably think of a few ones.

## Features
- 17 Awful items to ruin your host with.
- 2 Equipments that probably do something useful.
- 3 Artifacts to make your run harder, for some reason.

Keep in mind that with mods, anything can go wrong anytime, especially when you are loading 500 different mods at once, let me know if something breaks.

## Planned Features

- Finish the currently in-dev survivor.
- Finish the currently in-dev stage.
- Finish a new shrine.
- If you are interested in any of this, or the future, please contact me.
