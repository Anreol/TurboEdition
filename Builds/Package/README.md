# Turbo Edition Alpha
> **Note:** This is a very heavy **WIP** mod, **issues and bugs** can arise.
> The mod has been tested and *most features* are multiplayer compatible.

Turbo Edition is a content pack mod, that for now, it adds a couple of weird items and equipments.
Based off Risk Of Rain's Turbo Edition, it has a few returning items and new ones, but the goal of this mod is not to be a direct port, so keep in mind that some items will never come back, but it adds new ones, (and new features! *Soon!* )
Keep in mind that this is a single man made mod, so if you expected something big, I'm sorry to break it to you, but I cannot do everything at once!

Installation looks like
- plugins
	- TurboEdition
		- TurboEdition.dll
		- language AND assetbundles folders
## Why?
I'm pretty bad at coming up with names for what I make, and I followed Turbo Edition's development and just liked what it was.
I also find *"Turbo"* a funny word that goes along pretty well with a lot of other words. You can probably think of a few ones.

## Features
- 15 Awful items to ruin your host with.
- 1 Equipment that probably do something useful.
- 2 Artifacts to make your run harder, for some reason.

Unfinished content will be marked with a WIP icon, but keep in mind that with mods, anything can go wrong anytime, especially when you are loading 500 different mods at once!

## Planned Features

- Finish currently shipped content. That is the equipments and one artifact, along with probably models.
- Add a new Shrine, this turned out to have a very heavy refactoring so I didn't end up finishing it in time, maybe you know what it is about already!
- Survivors. I have up to 5 in mind, but the first one will probably be a simple one.
- More worthwhile items and equipment: Hopoo is adding over 60 items at once with the DLC, and there's countless mods already out there, meaning that items aren't really attracting me, so coming up with good items will be harder!

## Credits
- Bubbet & Moffein for giving me a hand in a few things and showing me how dumb some of my practices are.
- Kevin from HP support, learned a awful ton of Unity and proper practices thanks to my time spent in the SS2 team. Also, how the mod loads items is taken from there!
- Special thanks to Gnome, for introducing me to modding.
- Special thanks to JoeyAsagiri for making me want to make a mod myself. And by making the original mod!

I'm open to contributions, specifically models, as they take me more time than what I wished. You can contact me on your platform of choice, but if you choose Steam, and you have a suspicious profile, I'll probably reject you.

## Changelog
`0.0.1.0`
- Initial Release
	- Happy New Years!
