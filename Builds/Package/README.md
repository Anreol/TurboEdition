# Turbo Edition
### **Note:** This is a very heavy **WIP** mod, **issues and bugs** can arise.
The mod has been tested and while *most features* are multiplayer compatible, some things may not work.

Turbo Edition is a content pack mod, that for now, it adds a couple of weird items and equipments.
Based off Risk Of Rain's Turbo Edition, it has a few returning items and new ones, but the goal of this mod is not to be a direct port, so keep in mind that some items will never come back, but it adds new ones, (and new features! *Soon!* )
Keep in mind that this is a single man made mod, so if you expected something big, I'm sorry to break it to you, but I cannot do everything at once!

Installation looks like
- plugins
	- TurboEdition
		- TurboEdition.dll
		- language, assetbundles and soundbank folders
## Why?
I'm pretty bad at coming up with names for what I make, and I followed Turbo Edition's development and just liked what it was.
I also find *"Turbo"* a funny word that goes along pretty well with a lot of other words. You can probably think of a few ones.

## Features
- 17 Awful items to ruin your host with. (Some of them are currently disabled)
- 3 Equipments that probably do something useful.
- 3 Artifacts to make your run harder, for some reason.
	- One of them available as a wave in Simulacrum

Keep in mind that with mods, anything can go wrong anytime, especially when you are loading 500 different mods at once, let me know if something breaks.
