DocumentationRoot is a simple ScriptableObject that can reference a TextAsset 
for use as its landing page when selected in the 
[Documentation Window](menulink://Tools/ThunderKit/Documentation).

A DocumentationRoot can be created in any folder in a ThunderKit project via 
the Project Window Context Menu under the ThunderKit SubMenu.

Once created a DocumentationRoot's Main Page can be edited using Unity's 
[Inspector](menulink://Window/General/Inspector), and will become
immediately available in the ThunderKit Documentation window.
