ThunderKit comes with a number of templates to accelerate common workflows. Additionally, users can publish and retrieve additional templates to and from the ThunderKit Extensions Thunderstore at [https://thunderkit.thunderstore.io](https://thunderkit.thunderstore.io)

Contributions to these templates and this documentation are welcome.

This documentation will eventually cover the functionality provided by the templates and review how they work.
