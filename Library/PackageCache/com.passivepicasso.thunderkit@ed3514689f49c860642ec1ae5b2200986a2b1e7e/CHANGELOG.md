## 3.4.1

## Fixes

* Fix an issue where scanning some assemblies would result in a ReflectionTypeLoadException preventing the settings window from loading.

## 3.4.0

## PackageSource Management

PackageSources have been updated with central management and the ability to setup multiple sources of the same types.

You can now manage your Package Sources in the [ThunderKit Settings Window](menulink://Tools/ThunderKit/Settings).
In the ThunderKit Settings window you will be able to Add, Remove, Configure, Rename and Refresh your PackageSources.

## ThunderKit Extensions Thunderstore

With the ability to add multiple PackageSources to your project, you can now add the ThunderKit Extensions Thunderstore as a source. 
Like all Thunderstores, this provides the ability for the community to add resources that help grow the platform in a modular way.

If you would like to take advantage of the ThunderKit Extensions Thunderstore, Add a new ThunderstoreSource to your PackageSources and set the url to ``` https://thunderkit.thunderstore.io ```


## 3.3.0

## Steam Launch support

Some Unity games require that Steam launches them in order to successfully start up, to support this requirement the previous update added the RegistryLookup PathComponent.
This update builds upon that by adding a Steam.exe PathReference asset which locates the Steam.exe using the Windows Registry via the RegistryLookup PathComponent.

To improve the coverage and usability of the BepInEx Template, the template now includes a SteamBepInExLaunch Pipeline and the Launch Pipeline was renamed to BepInExLaunch

In Order to use the SteamBepInExLaunch Pipeline, copy it over the BepInExLaunch pipeline in your Build and Launch Pipeline, or replace BepInExLaunch anywhere you used it with the SteamBepInExLaunch pipeline.

References to the Launch Pipeline will be automatically updated to BepInExLaunch.

## Templates

Two new Templates have been added to ThunderKit under ThunderKit/Editor/Templates
DirectLaunch is a new pre-configured Launch pipeline which directly executes the game's Executable in its working directory.
SteamLaunch is a new pre-configured Launch pipeline which executes the game's Executable in its working directory using Steam and the applaunch command line argument.

## GameAppId and Steam Launching

In order to use any of the pre-configured Steam launching pipelines you will need to provide ThunderKit with the games Steam App Id.

Follow these Steps to setup Steam Launching
1. Create a new PathReference under your Assets directory and name it GameAppId
2. Add the Constant PathComponent to the newly created PathReference
3. Find the Steam App Id for the game you're modding
  * You can find the SteamAppId easily by copying it from the game's Steam Store page url

After Completing these steups you're seting to use Steam Launching.

## Fixes and Improvements

* Recently a ManifestIdentity data loss issue was re-discovered, this has not yet been resolved but some pieces of code have been updated in response while a proper resolution is pending
* Some PipelineJobs and PathComponents referenced a Manifests's ManifestIdentity by using LINQ to query for it in the Manifest's Data elements, these have been updated to use the Manifest's cached Identity reference.
* StageThunderstoreManifest has been updated to provide a clearer error when a dependency is missing its ManifestIdentity
* Some minor code cleanup was done against commented out code and unnecessary usings
* Fixed LocalThunderstoreSource not updating its listing when it already has Packages listed
* Fixed PackageSource.Clear Failing to clear Packages successfully under some conditions
* Fixed PackageManager failing to render correctly when a Package has invalid dependency information



## 3.2.0

### New Feature: PathComponent: Registry Lookup

the Registry Lookup path component has been added to support cases where values from the registry are needed to complete Pipeline efforts.
For example, some games require steam to execute them, and you may need to do so using the Steam executable.  
The installed Steam executable can easily be located by looking up the value in the registry, and this provides a path to that.

#### Performance Improvements

* ThunderstoreAPI has been updated to utilize gzip compression in order to greatly increase the speed of acquiring package listings.
* Fixed MarkdownRenderer's LinkInlineRenderer leaking handles and memory
* Fix an issue with SettingsWindowData and ThunderstoreSettings that would cause the settings window to have poor responsiveness

#### Bugs

* Fix a pageEntry.depth to be pageEntry.Depth in Documentation.cs for Unity 2019+
* Fix a NullReferenceException that could show up on the Settings window sometimes
* Fix cases in PackageManager that could cause a null reference and fail to load the manager UI
* Fix a problem that would cause a PackageSource to have no packages and be unable to be populated

## 3.1.7

## Fixes and Improvements

* Improve the Package Manager search responsiveness

## 3.1.6

## Fixes and Improvements

* Improve package import process with better ProgressBar status messages
* Install packages as final step of import process

## 3.1.1

This update implements support for .NET 3.5 and includes a number of general improvements and fixes

## New Features

### Optimization

Special thanks to Therzok for doing an optimization pass to clean up a number of cases where the code could be more efficient and cleaner.

### Package Manager
* Now updates when package sources are refreshed.
* Now refreshes package sources when opened.
* Now has a Refresh button next to the Filters button which will refresh all available PackageSources
* PackageSources now invoke the SourcesInitialized event when a source has been updated
* PackageSources can register an event handler on the InitializeSources event to be informed when it should update
* Thunderstore API no longer automatically updates on a timer

### 3.5 Migration changes

* Added csc.rsp and mcs.rsp to AssemblyDefinition containing folders to ensure that the correct language version is used for ThunderKit regardless of Scripting Back End choice.
* Removed Async/Await as its not available in 3.5
  * Some cases were replaced with other asynchronous mechanisms.
  * More cases will be moved to asynchronous mechanisms in the future, however there are currently a few that were migrated to synchronous execution.
* Migrate to Directory.GetFiles and Directory.GetDirectories over Directory.EnumerateFiles and Directory.EnumerateDirectories due to lack of support in .NET 3.5


### Zip Changes

* Migrated to SharpCompress from System.IO.Compression
* Updated zip handling in ThunderstoreSource and LocalThunderstoreSource
* Updated Zip PipelineJob to use SharpCompress

### Markdown / Documentation changes
* Improved method of locating Documentation assets
* Significant improvements made to the UIElementRenderer allocations
* Improvements to Regex Usage

### File System changes
* Migrated many file system management facilities to use FileUtil instead of System.IO types
* Updated Copy PipelineJob to use FileUtil  This changes how Copy works, A recursive copy will Replace the designated destination directory, not fill its contents
* Stage Manifest Files now uses FileUtil to deploy files

### BepInEx Template Changes

The BepInEx template has been updated to use some new features that arose out of the .NET 3.5 changes.
First, the template is somewhat large so it has been broken up into 4 Pipelines
1. Stage:  This pipeline executes StageAssetBundles, StageAssemblies, StageDependencies, StageManifestFiles and finally StageThunderstoreManifest.
2. Deploy: Conducts the following Copy jobs
    1. Copy BepInEx to ProjectRoot/ThunderKit/BepInExPack
    2. Copy plugins to ProjectRoot/ThunderKit/BepInExPack/BepInEx/plugins
    3. Copy patchers to ProjectRoot/ThunderKit/BepInExPack/BepInEx/patchers
    4. Copy monomods to ProjectRoot/ThunderKit/BepInExPack/BepInEx/monomod
    5. Copy winhttp.dll to the Games root directory
    6. Copy a BepInEx config targeted by the PathReference named BepInExConfig if it is defined in the project to ProjectRoot/ThunderKit/BepInExPack/BepInEx/config
3. Launch:  Executes the games executable with the necessary command line parameters to load BepInEx
4. Rebuild and Launch:  Executes the 3 prior Pipelines in order.

To get started on a new mod project you only need to copy the Rebuild and Launch pipeline into your Assets folder and then populate the Manifest field.

## 3.0.0 

#### Initial Setup
A Welcome window has been added to ThunderKit to help users set up their project.
This window can be disabled by a toggle it provides.

#### ThunderKit Installer - Removed
The ThunderKit installer has been removed.  The installer caused many development issues and lost
work during the development of ThunderKit. While this issue may not have affected end users, the 
risk associated with the cost of lost work makes this feature dangerous to continue to maintain.

Unity 2018.1-2019.2 users will need to add the Thunderkit dependency to their projects Packages/manifest.json

For Unity 2019.3+ users can add ThunderKit using the Git url and use the [Install from Git](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.3/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) option in the Unity Package Manager.

#### ThunderKit Settings

ThunderKit Settings now get a dedicated window from ThunderKit and can be accessed from the main menu under [Tools/ThunderKit/Settings](menulink://Tools/ThunderKit/Settings).
These settings will no longer show up in the Project Settings window.

#### Debugging Features

ComposableObjects now support some debugging features to provide an easy access interface to implementations of Composable Object to report errors in the UI.

ComposableElements now have 2 members, IsErrored and ErrorMessage. The ComposableObjectEditor will change the header color of ComposableElements to red if IsErrored is true, signalling where a problem may be.

Implementations of ComposableObject are responsible for setting the values in IsErrored and ErrorMessage.  

For examples see [Pipeline](assetlink://Packages/com.passivepicasso.thunderkit/Editor/Core/Pipelines/Pipeline.cs) 
and [PathReference](assetlink://Packages/com.passivepicasso.thunderkit/Editor/Core/Paths/PathReference.cs)

If a pipeline encounters a problem it will halt its execution and highlight the step that it faulted on.
The PipelineJobs and Pipeline itself are setup to log exceptions to the Unity console like normal, with these two pieces of information you should be able to quickly identify and rectify problems.

ThunderKit Manifests do not utilize these debugging features as they are only Data Containers, however if worth while usage for debugging issues can be identified then support will be added.

#### Dependencies

Dependency Management in the 3.0.0 update has changed significantly.  Instead of Manifests installing and managing dependencies in its entirety, Manifests will now only 
be responsible for containing dependency references.  

Instead a user will now install packages via the [Package Manager](menulink://Tools/ThunderKit/Packages), and then 
add the Manifest from the Packages folder to the Manifest that requires the dependency

#### Package Manager

ThunderKit now includes a complete Package Manager, available from the main menu under [Tools/ThunderKit/Packages](menulink://Tools/ThunderKit/Packages)

The ThunderKit Package Manager is how you will add and remove all mod dependencies for your project.
If a mod in your project needs to depend on a Mod, Loader, or Library, you have the ability to install these dependencies through the Package Manager.

Currently the Package Manager comes with support for Thunderstore by default, select your Thunderstore community by setting the url from the [ThunderKit Settings](menulink://Tools/ThunderKit/Settings).

You can also create a Local Thunderstore source where you can specify a folder to examine for zip files.
Zip files in Local Thunderstore Sources must conform to Thunderstore's file naming schemes in order to be resolved correctly. 

This scheme is: `Author-ModName-Version.zip`

#### Documentation
Documentation is a major issue for new users and as such ThunderKit now comes with integrated documentation to help onboard new users.
The documentation available from the main menu under Tools/ThunderKit/Documentation

Documentation is a work in progress and improvements will be made as a better understanding is gained about users needs for information.
