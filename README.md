# Turbo Edition

Turbo Edition is a content pack mod, akin to something you'd expect from Survivors of the Void or some other DLC.
Based off Risk Of Rain's Turbo Edition, it has a few returning items and new ones, but the goal of this mod is not to be a direct port, but rather a idea or concept.
Keep in mind that this is a single man made mod.

Installation looks like
- plugins
	- TurboEdition
		- TurboEdition.dll
		- language AND assetbundles folders
## Why?
I'm pretty bad at coming up with names for what I make, and I followed Turbo Edition's development and just liked what it was.
I also find *"Turbo"* a funny word that goes along pretty well with a lot of other words. You can probably think of a few ones.

## Contribution
This mod is meant to be a "anything goes" content pack, but with cohesion, meaning that I'm open to any ideas as long as they make sense and are grounded on some reality. Feel free to contribute with whatever you feel like, as the mod currently offers (or internally, has) at least one thing that the base game can offer. That is
- Items
- Void Items
- Equipment
- Buffs
- Survivor
- Enemies
- Interactionables
- Music
- Stages
- New Tiers
